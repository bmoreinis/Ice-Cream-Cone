# js-katas 
Instructions: 
First, copy one of the numbered code files into script. 
Then, study script, testing it and seeing what it does. 
Then, try removing some of the lines and leaving the comments. 
Try putting the lines back without looking at the numbered files. 
Eventually, you can remove ALL the lines and make a kata file.
